# 1. Klib: Live For Notes

## Focus on Now

The books we ever read become more and more. If put all these books together, we will be lost.

**Klib could put read books in a group, which can be collapsed.** You can even hide the book list and only read the notes.

**Tips:**

- You can select multi books and mark them as read. It's very useful after import for the first time.
- If you usually read pushed web pages in Kindle, you can merge them as one book.
- How to distinguish highlights and notes? Easy, the notes has a ✍️ Emoji icon in the beginning.

## Review Notes in Kindle for macOS

When review notes, we may want to read the book of that part again. In this case, **Klib could open Kindle for macOS and jump to the exact location of the note**. Very cool and useful.

You can also press `Space` key in Klib to quickly review it. Feel familiar?

## Open With Amazon

When review books, sometimes we want to view the table of contents, customer reviews, or other books written by same author. In this case, **Klib could open the book in Amazon with one click.**

## Free to Edit

You will feel free to edit book title, author, highlights, notes, etc.

## Search Anything

You can search any possible content:

- Book title
- Author
- Note
  - Content
  - Location
  - Date

Take an example, if I want to search the note with `value` which I read in `2017`, just search `2017 value`.

# 2. Klib: Start From Import

![](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3706/32780713934_3a23e27788_o.jpg)

## Import From Kindle

**How to import:**

- Connect your Kindle to Mac via USB.
- Clicks menu `File > Import from Kindle…` in Klib.
- Choose `Kindle` folder in the pop up dialog and start `Import`.

**Tips:**

- Only need to manually import for the first time. Later **Klib will automatically import when Kindle connected.**
- If you ever deleted books or notes, and want to restore. Just choose `Import ever deleted books or notes` during import.

Disadvantage of this way:

- Need to connect Kindle via USB each time.
- Doesn't include notes made by Kindle for iPhone or other Kindle clients.

## Import From Amazon

**Recommend to import from Amazon, which is very easy to use.**

- Wirelessly import, no need to connect Kindle via USB.
- Could also import notes made by other Kindle clients.

**How to import:**

**How to export:**

**Tips:**

After copy notes as Markdown, you can easily share them in your blog or anywhere else.

In fact, this is why I developed Klib. After reading a book, I would like to summarize it in my blog. And the highlights and notes are important parts of the summary. So, I made Klib to copy them as Markdown.

## Export Database

You can easily export entire database of Klib, and then share with others, or sync among different computers.

**How to export:**

- Clicks menu `File > Export…` in Klib.
- You can also export only the selected books. Just select the books, press `Option` key, and then clicks menu `File > Export Selected Book…` in Klib.

**Tips:**

- How to import the exported database? It's the same with import from Kindle. Just choose the database files during import.
